# scss-bootstrap
Uses bootstrap 4.1.3 with a simple importer that allows you to cherrypick parts of Bootstrap.

## Setup
Once you've downloaded the library you should follow the same pattern as the scss setup and configured here. 
Inside of the scss/abstracts/_variables.scss file you can turn on and off aspects of bootstrap for modularity.
